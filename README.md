## Installation

1. **Install Python dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. **For Linux users, install additional tools (optional):**
```bash
# For screenshots
sudo apt install scrot

# For WiFi management
sudo apt install network-manager

# For volume control
sudo apt install alsa-utils

# For document conversion (LibreOffice)
sudo apt install libreoffice
```

3. **Run the application:**
```bash
python ai_operator.py
```

## ⚡ Quick tools added

### Cross-platform direct file search (safe, fast)
If you just want to search the filesystem for a filename (for example "obed") without using the premium indexer, there's a lightweight CLI and helper utility included.

Example:
```bash
# search for files or folders containing 'obed' (auto-detects root folders)
python run_search.py --name obed

# search from a specific path
python run_search.py --name obed --root /home/youruser --max 100

# get JSON output to pipe into other tools
python run_search.py --name obed --json
```

Programmatically (REPL):
```python
from search_utils import find_files_by_name
matches = find_files_by_name('obed', max_results=100)
print(matches)
```

This search will safely skip permission errors and limit results so it won't freeze your machine.

### Auto-setup installer (one-command environment setup)
We added an `auto_setup.py` script that detects your OS, creates a virtual environment, and installs Python dependencies for you. On Linux you can optionally ask it to install recommended system packages (requires sudo).

Examples:
```bash
# create a venv and install python requirements
python auto_setup.py

# create venv, install python requirements and attempt system-level packages on Debian/Ubuntu (requires sudo)
python auto_setup.py --install-system

# install into your current environment instead of creating venv
python auto_setup.py --no-venv
```

Notes:
- Installing system packages (`--install-system`) uses `apt` and requires sudo on Linux; the script will provide safe instructions if it can't run them automatically.
- On Windows, the script will install Python packages via pip; system-level packages (like LibreOffice) can be installed by the user via `winget` or `choco` (the script prints suggested commands).

### Single-file, one-click binaries (Windows and Linux)

We provide an entry point `entry_point.py` and a simple build helper `build_package.py` so you can create a single-file executable using PyInstaller.

Important:
- You should build the binary on the target operating system for best compatibility (i.e. build on Windows to create a .exe, build on Linux to create a Linux ELF binary). Cross-building is possible with extra tooling but outside the scope of this script.
- The PyInstaller-built binary bundles Python and the Python-level dependencies so your friend does not need to install the Python packages or venv. System-level tools (e.g., LibreOffice, scrot) cannot be bundled and may still be required for some features.

Build example (on the OS you want the binary for):

```bash
# install build-time dependencies (on build machine)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# produce a single-file binary
python3 build_package.py --entry entry_point.py --output build --name DesktopAI

# produced artifact will be in ./build/DesktopAI (or DesktopAI.exe on Windows)
```

### One-click GUI installer (for non-technical users)

If you want a very easy install path for friends who are not comfortable with terminals, there's a tiny GUI installer included:

```bash
python3 gui_installer.py
```

This opens a simple installer window where users can pick to create a virtualenv and install Python dependencies. On Linux it optionally installs a small set of recommended system packages (prompts before doing so).


If you want cross-platform builds or CI to automatically produce binaries for Windows + Linux, consider using GitHub Actions or a builder that runs on both targets (recommended).

### AI-powered smart search

We've added an AI-assisted search helper (`ai_search.py`) that ranks results using fuzzy matching plus recency/context boosts from the system index. It makes the assistant "smarter" at finding the right file quickly.

Features:
- Fuzzy filename matching (tolerates typos and partial names)
- Boosting of recently used files (uses the app's access history when available)
- Falls back to a fast direct filesystem scan when the index is missing or results are sparse

Try it from the GUI: open the app and click "Smart Search" or using the CLI/entry point:

```bash
# CLI (uses AI ranking if available)
python3 entry_point.py --cli --search "obed" --max 200

# Direct AI search (debugging)
python3 ai_search.py --q obed --max 200
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied" errors:**
   - Run with admin/sudo privileges for system operations
   - Some folders may require elevated permissions

2. **WiFi commands not working:**
   - Install network-manager (Linux) or ensure WiFi is enabled
   - May require admin privileges

3. **Screenshot not working:**
   - Install scrot (Linux) or gnome-screenshot
   - Ensure display is accessible

4. **Volume control not working:**
   - Install alsa-utils (Linux) or ensure audio system is running

5. **Browser operations not working:**
   - Ensure Firefox, Chrome, or Edge is installed
   - Check if browsers are in system PATH
   - Try using "list browsers" to see available options

6. **Document operations failing:**
   - Install required Python packages: `pip install python-docx PyPDF2 pdfplumber`
   - For PDF conversion, install LibreOffice
   - Check file permissions and paths

7. **GUI password prompt not appearing:**
   - Ensure tkinter is properly installed
   - Check if running in a graphical environment
   - Try running with `python3` instead of `python`

### Getting Help

The application includes built-in examples and help. Use the "System Info" button to check your system compatibility, and "Check Dependencies" to verify document processing libraries.

## Security Note

This application can perform system-level operations like shutting down your computer, killing processes, and opening browsers. The new GUI password prompts provide better security for system operations on Linux. Use with caution and ensure you understand the commands you're running.
