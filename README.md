## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Permission denied" errors:**
   - Run with admin/sudo privileges for system operations
   - Some folders may require elevated permissions

2. **WiFi commands not working:**
   - Install network-manager (Linux) or ensure WiFi is enabled
   - May require admin privileges

3. **Screenshot not working:**
   - Install scrot (Linux) or gnome-screenshot
   - Ensure display is accessible

4. **Volume control not working:**
   - Install alsa-utils (Linux) or ensure audio system is running

5. **Browser operations not working:**
   - Ensure Firefox, Chrome, or Edge is installed
   - Check if browsers are in system PATH
   - Try using "list browsers" to see available options

6. **Document operations failing:**
   - Install required Python packages: `pip install python-docx PyPDF2 pdfplumber`
   - For PDF conversion, install LibreOffice
   - Check file permissions and paths

7. **GUI password prompt not appearing:**
   - Ensure tkinter is properly installed
   - Check if running in a graphical environment
   - Try running with `python3` instead of `python`

### Getting Help

The application includes built-in examples and help. Use the "System Info" button to check your system compatibility, and "Check Dependencies" to verify document processing libraries.

## Security Note

This application can perform system-level operations like shutting down your computer, killing processes, and opening browsers. The new GUI password prompts provide better security for system operations on Linux. Use with caution and ensure you understand the commands you're running.
